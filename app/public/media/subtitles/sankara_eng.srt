1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In 1987, Thomas Sankara, Burkina Faso´s president, 
gave a speech against debt in the summit of the African Union.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The emancipation of its people and the freedom and development of the African
 countries could only happen after the abolition of the historical debt to the west.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This revolutionary demand cost him his life.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,360
We think that the debt has to be seen from the standpoint of its origins.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,800
Debt’s origins come from colonialism’s origins.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Those who lend us money are those who had colonalized us before.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
They are those who used to manage our states and economies.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Colonizers are those who indebted Africa 
through their brothers and cousins.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,600
We had no connections with this debt.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Therefore we cannot pay for it.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Debt is neo-colonialism, in which colonizers 
transferred themselves into “technical assistant”.

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,500
We should better say “technical assassins”.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,600
They present us with financing, with financial backers.

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,800
As if someone’s back could create development.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
We have been advised to go to these lenders.

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,000
We have been proposed with nice financial set ups.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,400
We have been indebted for 50, 60 years and even more.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,360
That means we have been led to compromise 
our people for fifty years and more.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,900
Under its current form, that is imperialism controlled.

20
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Debt is a cleverly managed re-conquest of Africa.
